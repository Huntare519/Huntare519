## üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Hunter.

I'm originally from Minnesota, where I grew up playing soccer, spending time outside, and reading. 

On campus, at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, I'm the president at Badger Blockchain where we seek to educate and network UW-Madison students on blockchain, crypto, and web3.

Previously, I was a Cyber-Security co-op with [Sub-Zero Group](https://www.subzero-wolf.com), where I learned about incident response, project management, mitigating CVEs, among other things. After, I continued my work at Sub-Zero as a Software QA Engineer part-time. As a QA developer, I built internal automation tools for our IoT devices utilizing python3, TestRails, and Azure.

I just finished interning with [MITRE](https://www.mitre.org) for the summer before I return for my final year at UW. There, I did full-stack/security engineering, and worked a lot with GraphQL, Java Spring Boot, Typescript, and React.

I'm particularly interested in getting involved with engineering that is increasing how efficiently we use our collective resources, renewable energy, blockchains, security, and their intersections.

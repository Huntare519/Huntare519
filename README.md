## 👋 Hi, I’m Hunter.

I grew up in a suburb of St.Paul, Minnesota where I enjoyed spending time outside.

On campus, at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, I am the president at Badger Blockchain where we seek to educate and network UW-Madison students on blockchain.

Previously, I was a Cyber-Security co-op with (Sub-Zero Group)[https://www.subzero-wolf.com], where I learned about incident response, project management, mitigating CVEs, among other things. Also, I worked at Sub-Zero as a Software QA Engineer part-time. As a QA developer, I built internal automation tools for our IoT devices utilizing python3, TestRails, and Azure.

Now, i'm interning with [MITRE](https://www.mitre.org) for Summer 2022 before I return for my final year at UW.

I'm particularly interested in getting involved with engineering that is increasing how efficiently we use our collective resources, renewable energy, blockchains, security, and their intersections.

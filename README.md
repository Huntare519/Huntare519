__- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hunter.__

I grew up in a suburb of St.Paul, Minnesota where I enjoyed spending time outside.

On campus, at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, I am the president at Badger Blockchain where we seek to educate and network UW-Madison students on blockchain.

Previously, I worked at the UW-Madison Division of Information Technology as a Advanced Support Specialist (phones, chat, and email) at our Help Desk. We support students, staff, and faculty to help diagnose and troubleshoot various supported softwares and systems.

I was also a Cyber-Security co-op with Sub-Zero Group, where I learned about incident response, project management, mitigating CVEs, among other things. Now, I work at Sub-Zero as a Software QA Engineer while also attending school. As a QA developer, I am building internal automation tools for our IoT devices utilizing python3, TestRails, and Azure.

I'm particularly interested in getting involved with engineering that is increasing how efficiently we use our collective resources, renewable energy, blockchains, security, and their intersections.

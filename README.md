- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Huntare519

I grew up in a suburb of St.Paul, Minnesota where I enjoyed spending time outside.

On campus, at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, I am the president at Badger Blockchain where we seek to educate and network UW-Madison students on blockchain.

Previously, I worked at the UW-Madison Division of Information Technology as a Advanced Support Specialist (phones, chat, and email) at the Help Desk. We support students, staff, and faculty to help diagnose and troubleshoot various supported softwares and systems.

I'm particularly interested in getting involved with engineering that is increasing how efficiently people use our collective resources.

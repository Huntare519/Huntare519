## üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Hunter.

I'm originally from Minnesota, where I grew up playing soccer, spending time outside, and reading. 

Previously, in 2021, I was a Cyber-Security co-op with [Sub-Zero Group](https://www.subzero-wolf.com), where I learned about incident response, project management, and mitigating CVEs, among other things. After that, I continued my work at Sub-Zero as a Software QA Engineer part-time. As a QA developer, I built internal automation tools for our IoT devices utilizing python3, TestRails, and Azure.

In 2022, I interned with [MITRE](https://www.mitre.org) for the summer before I returned for my final year at UW. There, I did full-stack/security engineering and worked extensively with GraphQL, Java Spring Boot, Typescript, and React.

I'm particularly interested in getting involved with engineering increasing how efficiently we use our collective resources, renewable energy, access control/smart locks, security, and their intersections.
